Advent of Code 2018 in Rust!

I know _very little_ Rust or systems programming, but learning it is ridiculously fun!

Having experience with function languages like Clojure, Haskell, and OCaml made me
unlearn quite a bit in terms of how I view programs, and now I feel as Rust is making
me do the same to _those_ languages (it's okay to mutate!).
